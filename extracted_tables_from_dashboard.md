## Notes
- Both salary tables appear to represent different cohorts or time slices filtered by the same metric (End Date of Employment).
- A significant majority of participants report $0 income, especially in Table A.
- Table B shows a healthier distribution across mid-range salaries, suggesting progression or a different population slice.
