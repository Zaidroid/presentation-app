**Anqaa \- Pheonix rising from ashes**

**SLIDE**

Online digital work is one of the few sectors that can thrive in Palestine. It overcomes the severe restrictions of physical movement by allowing Palestinian talent to work remotely online for clients around the world.

Before October 2023, the Palestinian tech sector was becoming internationally recognised as a location to find superb tech talent at an attractive price. 

This is understandable. The Palestinian population is young (50% under 25), educated (Palestine ranks high in world literacy and university education), Arabic speaking with good English, with a time zone to work remotely for clients in Europe, USA and middle east.

**image showing destruction and economic decline**

Since Oct 2023, it has been a catastrophe for the people and the economy. Massive devastation and deaths in Gaza, and the collapse of an already weak economy in the West Bank.

The tech sector has been similarly impacted, with physical destruction of infrastructure and talent in Gaza, and economic destruction across the WB.

Despite this, like the “Anqaa” Pheonix rising from ashes (and literally so in Gaza \!) we see many signs of revival, hope, and success. 

Individuals and organisations around the world are contributing practical assistance and collaborating. Companies, employees, NGOs, volunteers, tech gurus, business advisors, and academics are providing skills trainings, mentors, business advice, internships and connections to jobs and income generating projects.

In Gaza, the tech community is creating coworking spaces, sometimes using large tents fitted with desks, wifi, and powered by solar panels. These are the foundation to allow Gazans to return to learning and earning online.

**5,000 individuals (2,000 training graduates & 3,000 awareness participants)**

**35 companies**

**5 coworking spaces**

**Return to on trainings inside Gaza**

- Volumes of participants in trainings (approx. 2,000 trainings, 3,000 awareness and experiential initiatives, 33 Elevate companies)  
- Wide variety of skills (very technical to less technical)  
- 5 coworking spaces in Gaza

Gaza Sky Geeks never stopped operating. After Oct 2023, we paused activities in Gaza and delivered services online from our expanded team in Ramallah and a reduced team in Gaza. Our purpose remained the same … to help Palestinian individuals and companies generate incomes from international markets, bringing revenue and jobs into the local community and economy. 

We train thousands each year in specialist tech and employability skills, and connect them to international mentors, recruiters, internships and jobs. In 2025, over 5,000 individuals and 35 tech companies graduated our trainings and support programmes. We are humbled that 30% of participants joined from Gaza, despite their awful conditions.

In addition to trainings, GSG’s Elevate programme assists Palestinian tech companies to expand internationally by enhancing technical skills of employees, combined with support for sales, marketing and legal.

Since mid 2025, GSG has provided financial support to 5 coworking spaces in Gaza. The spaces are foundational for revival by providing seats for Palestinians to return to learning and earning online. Gaza needs many more coworking spaces. 

And in late 2025, GSG restarted on the ground training activities inside Gaza.

The tech sector is facing huge challenges. 

We must continue to collaborate. 

And we must continue to connect to international markets. This is critical. 

Ultimately, the Palestinian tech sector, the economy and livelihoods of Palestinian people is dependent on accessing international customers. The local market is effectively non-existent.

The purpose of today’s event is to present the new GSG Elevate programme. And we invite tech & digital companies to apply to join this cohort.

You will hear the impact of our previous Elevate programme and how this has assisted companies in 2025\. 

I am very pleased that we our last cohort also assisted companies in Gaza. 

ELEAVTE is driven by the needs of the companies. We offer a wide range of assistance activities that are designed to fit with the needs of each company.

We listen and learn from the previous cohorts and then we adapt and enhance the activities to bring most benefit.

For example:

Our TTH (train to hire) programme covers the cost of paying interns to work in Palestinian companies. This provides a supply of qualified talent to gain experience inside your company. Our results show that 70% of the interns were retained by the Palestinian companies at the end of the internships.

Last year, we also saw that some Palestinian companies are struggling to pay and retain existing employees. So in this cohort you will see that we are expanding the programme to help you to upskill existing employees and cover some of the costs of retaining them.

You will also hear about the new initiative, ELEVATE BRIDGE, where we will pay successful Palestinian freelancers to work as sales people for your companies to help you win new projects. We hope that this will help your companies to secure more revenue and retain employees.

To all of the donors in the room.

Of course the greatest and most critical need is humanitarian aid in Gaza and across the WB.

GSG is classified as an economic development programme.

I ask you to also recognise that GSG complements these humanitarian aid programmes. It enables people to very quickly earn incomes and cease being dependent on aid.

- Every individual that we can help to earn an income online enables a family to rise up and no longer be 100% dependent on aid.  
- And we achieve this quickly.   
- Very little cost is required. All they need is a laptop & internet access

Pre the war, our statistics showed that 70% of our participants went on to earn incomes online after completing our trainings. And that the average income was $700 / month, after 12 months from completing a GSG programme. 

Data from our recent graduates in 2025 shows similar results.

- 70% of the interns were hired by the host companies  
- Average income 6 months after completing long trainings in 2025, we are already seeing some of these participants secure income (check income data with Marwan)

Currently GSG is funded by 2 multi-year grants from our Dutch and Swedish government partners. This ensures that GSG can now continue to deliver its services for another 2 – 3 years. 

But we desperately seek more funds.

With additional funds, we can easily expand the volume of individual participants to many more thousands of individuals each year, and to dozens more Palestinian tech companies per year

And most especially we need funds for Coworking spaces in Gaza.

Coworking spaces are the foundations to revival in Gaza.  
Coworking spaces give large volumes of individuals and tech companies in Gaza the chance to return to learning and earning online. 

As mentioned, in 2025, we had the funds to support 5 spaces.  
We want to support 50 spaces, spread across the Gaza so many more students and online workers can have reliable access to work.

$100 donated through our donation page will cover the cost of 1 person accessing a space for 1 month.

Imagine what we could do with another larger grant.

I will now hand over to my colleagues to descrive in detail the GSG programmes.

Before I do so, I would like to extend thanks to all of the GSG team, and especially to the ELEVATE team who created the programme in very difficult times at the start of 2024, and we are seeing the impact of this superb programme. Thank you Israa, Raouf, Zaid, Douaa, Mohammed, Muna
